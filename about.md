![Me](/images/me.jpg)

I'm Jordan Andrews ([@codingupastorm](https://twitter.com/codingupastorm)), an Australian software developer. I enjoy working on difficult problems, especially in the domains of both cryptocurrency and quantum computing.

I write here about software-related things that are interesting to me.
