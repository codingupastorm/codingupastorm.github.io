![Me](/images/me.jpg)

Hey there, 

I'm Jordan Andrews ([@codingupastorm](https://twitter.com/codingupastorm)), an Australian software developer. I enjoy working on difficult problems, especially in the domains of cryptocurrency and quantum computing. I really enjoy working with C# / .NET and Rust, but I have experience delivering and reviewing code in Javascript, C++ and Groovy among many others. 

I write here about software-related things that are interesting to me. 

I can help you with building software, testing software, reviewing code, solution architecture or improving your team's development process. Please get in touch through one of the social links above or via the [contact form](/contact).

I work out of Melbourne, Australia but I have experience working remotely for companies globally.
