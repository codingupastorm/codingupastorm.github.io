I haven't posted in 3 years. I'm pursuing some private study / learning into Neuroscience generally, and trying to find some interesting, solvable problems I can commit to contributing to, bringing my previous experience in general software engineering.

I'm deliberately avoiding academic research - something like pursuing a PhD. I'll post about why one day.

What I want to do is share what I'm learning and looking into with some cadence. I could note this privately, but I think there are some benefits to it being public. 
- I'm loosely committed to continue to work and post by talking about it publicly
- Writing about things forces one to have clarity of thought, so I get a chance to refine my own thinking
- Assuming I do "get somewhere" with this, it could provide a useful roadmap for myself or others on how I got here. (I'd love to elaborate also on what "get somewhere" means - again I'll post why one day.)


The format will evolve as I go. 

## Here's what I'm thinking about now

Current wider ideas:
- For the most part, academic code is poorly readable, not highly reusable, and slow.
- There is starting to be a heap of data available online, which, so far as I can tell, noone is using cohesively. See [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/)
- There are a heap of documented problems available online, usually in the form of PhD breifings. See [The Florey Institute](https://florey.edu.au/careers-and-study/studying-at-the-florey/) for an example.

Specific Learnings:
- It seems like the most available and useful format for gathering information from living brains is the MRI. An MRI can retrieve different data based on running MRI sequences. 
- Tractography is a specific imaging technique based on a set of particular MRI sequences, the DWI (Diffusion Weighted Image)
- I think this is a good starting resource for tractography, which I got to by following a more recent article on tractography, which was part of a PhD brief: [Hot topics in diffusion tractography](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/cognitiveaxon/documents/DellAcqua_Catani_2013.pdf)
